abstract = {Glutathione S-tranferases (GST) are multigenic enzymes that have been associated  with arsenic metabolism. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between polymorphic variants of GST and urinary concentration of arsenic species in people exposed to low levels of arsenic. A cross-sectional study among 66 nonoccupationally exposed subjects, living in the city of Antofagasta, Chile. Polymorphic variants were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and arsenic species was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The effect of GST variants on arsenic concentration was evaluated using univariate and covariate-adjusted regressions. For both GSTT1 and GSTM1 there were no significant differences in detected arsenic relative species between carriers of the active and null polymorphic variants. There was nondefinitive evidence that polymorphic variants of GST play a role in arsenic metabolism in sample of the Chilean subjects studied.},

abstract = {To quantify fluoride in food it is necessary to extract the fluoride from the matrix. Dry ashing (alkali fusion) and facilitated diffusion are the methods most commonly used, but their application requires lengthy treatments. The present study proposes the use of a microwave oven and 7 mol/L nitric acid for simple, rapid digestion of foods for fluoride analysis. The analyte is subsequently quantified by fluoride ion-selective electrode. The various steps of the method were optimized and an in-house validation was performed. The limit of quantification (0.130 mg/kg), trueness (92%), recovery (84-101%), and precision (1-8%) were determined. These analytical characteristics are satisfactory and show the suitability of the method for analysis of fluoride in foods of various kinds. The method's ease of application and the use of equipment normally found in food analysis laboratories may help to further increase research on fluoride concentrations in foods consumed by the population. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Excessive fluoride intake may be harmful for health, producing dental and skeletal fluorosis, and effects upon neurobehavioral development. Studies in animals have revealed effects upon the gastrointestinal, renal and reproductive systems. Some of the disorders may be a consequence of immune system alterations.In this study, an in vitro evaluation is made of fluoride immunotoxicity using the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage line over a broad range of concentrations (2.5-75 mg/L). The results show that the highest fluoride concentrations used (50-75 mg/L) reduce the macrophage population in part as a consequence of the generation of reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species and consequent redox imbalance, which in turn is accompanied by lipid peroxidation. A decrease in the expression of the antiinflammatory cytokine Il10 is observed from the lowest concentrations (5 mg/L). High concentrations (50 mg/L) in turn produce a significant increase in the proinflammatory cytokines Il6 and Mip2 from 4 h of exposure. In addition, cell phagocytic capacity is seen to decrease at concentrations of ≥. 20 mg/L. These data indicate that fluoride, at high concentrations, may affect macrophages and thus immune system function - particularly with regard to the inflammation autoregulatory processes, in which macrophages play a key role.},

abstract = {Fluoride is an important element for humans. It inhibits initiation and progression of dental caries and stimulates bone formation. However, excessive intake may lead to the appearance of dental and/or skeletal fluorosis and a decrease in intellectual coefficient in child populations. This study evaluates exposure to fluoride in the child population of Chaco province (Argentina) by analysis of drinking water, food and its bioaccessible fraction (quantity of fluoride solubilised by gastrointestinal digestion and available for intestinal absorption) and urine as a biomarker of internal dose. The concentration of fluoride in drinking water varied between 0.050 and 4.6 mg L−1, and 80% of the samples exceeded the WHO drinking-water guideline value (1.5 mg L−1). Fluoride concentrations in food ranged between 0.80 and 3.0 mg kg−1 fresh weight (fw), being lower in bioaccessible fraction (0.43–1.9 mg kg−1, fw). On the basis of the consumption data declared for the young child population, fluoride intake varies between 4.1 and 6.5 mg day−1, greater than the level recommended for this age group. Moreover, in some cases, concentrations of fluoride found in urine (0.62–8.9 mg L−1) exceeded those reported in areas with declared fluorosis. All data obtained show the worrying situation of child population in this area of Argentina.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is a neoplasm characterized by an extensive blood vessel network. Hypoxic niches of GBM can induce tumorigenic properties of a small cell subpopulation called Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) and can also increase extracellular adenosine generation which activates the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR). Moreover, GSCs potentiates the persistent neovascularization in GBM. The aim of this study was to determine if A3AR blockade can reduce the vasculogenesis mediated by the differentiation of GSCs to Endothelial Cells (ECs) under hypoxia. We evaluated the expression of endothelial cell markers (CD31, CD34, CD144, and vWF) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by ELISA using MRS1220 (A3AR antagonist) under hypoxia. We validate our results using U87MG-GSCs A3AR knockout (GSCsA3-KO). The effect of MRS1220 on blood vessel formation was evaluated in vivo using a subcutaneous GSCs-tumor model. GSCs increased extracellular adenosine production and A3AR expression under hypoxia. Hypoxia also increased the percentage of GSCs positive for endothelial cell markers and VEGF secretion, which was in turn prevented when using MRS1220 and in GSCsA3-KO. Finally, in vivo treatment with MRS1220 reduced tumor size and blood vessel formation. Blockade of A3AR decreases the differentiation of GSCs to ECs under hypoxia and in vivo blood vessel formation.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study is to determine the effect of inorganic arsenic (As) and its metabolites on the viability of the neural progenitor cell (NPC) line C17.2, in order to evaluate cellular mechanisms involved in As developmental neurotoxicity. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of the coexposure to As and fluoride (F), a situation to which some populations are commonly exposed. Our results show that NPCs are not susceptible to pentavalent As species [arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid, and dimethylarsinic acid] and F alone. However, the trivalent metabolites of arsenate [arsenite, monomethylarsonous acid, and dimethylarsinous acid] are toxic at concentrations below 1. mg/l, and this susceptibility increases when there is coexposure with F (≥5. mg/l). Arsenite triggers apoptosis after 24. h of exposure, whereas monomethylarsonous acid produces necrosis at very short times (2. h). Arsenite leads to an increase in intracellular Ca levels and generation of reactive oxygen species, which may cause a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and consequent activation of caspases. A slight activation of calpain also takes place, which might favor activation of the mitochondrial pathway or might activate other pathways. The treatment with some antioxidants such as quercetin and $\alpha$-tocopherol shows only a partial reduction of the cytotoxicity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Water and food are the main sources of fluoride exposure and therefore it is necessary to study intestinal absorption in order to make a correct evaluation of the risk/benefit associated with exposure to fluoride. The present study characterizes intestinal transport of fluoride, using the Caco-2 cell line as a model of the intestinal epithelium, and evaluates the coefficients of apparent permeability and intracellular accumulation in various conditions (pH, temperature, opening of cell junctions, presence of anions).The results indicate that fluoride is an element with moderate absorption (<70%) in both directions (absorptive and secretory). Both in absorption (apical-basolateral) and in secretion (basolateral-apical) there is transport by the paracellular pathway, which may be considered predominant. Absorption and secretion of fluoride increase at acid pH levels, possibly because of its non-ionized state at these pHs and/or because of participation of a F-/H+ cotransporter or a F-/OH- antiporter. The results also suggest transcellular participation of mechanisms involved in transport of Cl- and of an active transport in the secretory direction. The present study extend the knowledge on the cellular transport of fluoride and provide the basis for future studies aimed at identifying potential transporters involved in human fluoride absorption. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The influence of cell type, pH, mucus layer, bile salts and food matrices on the apparent permeability coefficient (P app) was evaluated. The results show that a higher proportion of HT29-MTX in the monolayer produces an increase in F permeability, although the mucus layer secreted by HT29-MTX decreases F transport. The results also show that taurocholic acid, a component of bile salts, and acid pH increase F permeability, whereas the presence of a food matrix (rice) decreases intestinal transport of F. In all cases, alterations in F permeability were closely related with modulation of cell junctions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

However, excessive intake has negative effects. The main pathway for exposure is oral, through consumption of drinking water, and some food products. Therefore its bioaccessibility (quantity of the element solubilized during the digestive process) is a parameter to be considered when estimating the risk/benefit associated with this element. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the digestion phase, gastrointestinal digestion factors (pH, pepsin and bile salt concentrations) and the presence of cations on the bioaccessibility of fluoride from seafood products.The results show that the solubilization of fluoride takes place entirely during the gastric phase. Its bioaccessibility is strongly influenced by conditions that favor the formation of insoluble complexes of fluoride with other elements present in the matrix. The factors that are most influential in reducing its bioaccessibility are the increase in pH in the gastric phase, the presence of cations, especially in the intestinal phase, and a low concentration of bile salts. {\textcopyright} 2013.},
